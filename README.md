## 🗺️ Overview

> Reversi is a turn-based strategy board game involving 2 players who play black and white disks on an 8x8 board. The players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The objective of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display one's color when the last playable empty square is filled.
